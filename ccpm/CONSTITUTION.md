# Project Constitution

**Last Updated:** [DATE]
**Version:** 1.0

## Purpose

This constitution defines the core principles, standards, and decision-making framework for this project. All PRDs, epics, and tasks must align with these principles.

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage for critical paths
- **Documentation**: All public APIs must have comprehensive documentation
- **Type Safety**: Use static typing where available (TypeScript, Python type hints, etc.)
- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review before merging

### 2. Architectural Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers (UI, Business Logic, Data)
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract common patterns into reusable components
- **SOLID Principles**: Follow object-oriented design best practices
- **API-First**: Design APIs before implementation
- **Database Migrations**: All schema changes must be versioned and reversible

### 3. Security Standards

- **Authentication**: Use industry-standard authentication (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user input
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
- **Dependency Security**: Regular security audits of dependencies
- **Secrets Management**: Never commit secrets to version control

### 4. Performance Standards

- **Page Load Time**: Initial page load < 3 seconds
- **API Response Time**: 95th percentile < 500ms
- **Database Queries**: N+1 queries are prohibited
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- **Resource Limits**: Set and enforce memory/CPU limits

### 5. User Experience Principles

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
- **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Error Handling**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Loading States**: Show feedback during async operations
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent UI/UX patterns

## Technology Stack

### Approved Technologies

**Frontend:**
- [Framework]: React/Vue/Angular (specify)
- [State Management]: Redux/Vuex/Pinia (specify)
- [Styling]: Tailwind/CSS Modules (specify)

**Backend:**
- [Language]: Node.js/Python/Go (specify)
- [Framework]: Express/FastAPI/Gin (specify)
- [Database]: PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB (specify)

**DevOps:**
- [CI/CD]: GitHub Actions/GitLab CI (specify)
- [Containerization]: Docker
- [Orchestration]: Kubernetes/Docker Compose (specify)

### Technology Evaluation Criteria

When proposing new technologies, evaluate:
1. **Maturity**: Is it production-ready and well-maintained?
2. **Community**: Active community and good documentation?
3. **Performance**: Does it meet our performance standards?
4. **Security**: Is it secure and regularly updated?
5. **Learning Curve**: Can the team adopt it efficiently?
6. **Cost**: What are the licensing/hosting costs?

## Decision-Making Framework

### Architecture Decisions

**Who Decides:**
- Major architecture changes: Tech lead + team consensus
- Minor changes: Developer + code reviewer

**Documentation:**
- Document all significant decisions in ADR (Architecture Decision Records)
- Include: Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives Considered

### Dependency Management

**Adding New Dependencies:**
1. Check if existing dependency can solve the problem
2. Evaluate package quality (stars, downloads, last update)
3. Check security vulnerabilities
4. Consider bundle size impact
5. Get approval from tech lead for significant dependencies

### Breaking Changes

**Process:**
1. Discuss impact with team
2. Create migration plan
3. Update documentation
4. Provide deprecation warnings
5. Set timeline for removal

## Development Workflow

### Git Workflow

- **Branching**: Feature branches from `main`
- **Commits**: Conventional Commits format
- **Pull Requests**: Required for all changes
- **Squash Merging**: Squash commits before merging
- **Version Tags**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

### Code Review Standards

**Reviewers Must Check:**
- Code follows style guide
- Tests are comprehensive
- Documentation is updated
- No security vulnerabilities
- Performance impact is acceptable
- Constitution alignment

**Review Timeline:**
- Normal PRs: Within 24 hours
- Urgent fixes: Within 4 hours
- Large features: Within 48 hours

### Testing Requirements

**Required Tests:**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for high-traffic endpoints

**Test Quality:**
- Tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)
- Tests must be fast (< 10 seconds for unit tests)
- Tests must be maintainable (clear names, minimal mocking)

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Commit

- Code linting passes
- Code formatting passes
- Type checking passes (if applicable)

### Pre-Merge

- All tests pass
- Code coverage threshold met
- Security scan passes
- Performance benchmarks pass

### Pre-Release

- Full integration test suite passes
- Security audit completed
- Documentation updated
- Release notes prepared

## Exceptions and Waivers

### When to Break the Rules

Sometimes constitution rules can be temporarily waived:

**Valid Reasons:**
- Critical production incident requiring immediate fix
- Prototype/proof-of-concept development
- Technical debt that will be addressed in follow-up task

**Process:**
1. Document the exception in PR description
2. Get explicit approval from tech lead
3. Create follow-up issue to address technical debt
4. Add TODO comment in code with issue reference

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Constitution Updates

**Who Can Propose:**
- Any team member can propose changes

**Approval Process:**
1. Create proposal as PR to this document
2. Team discussion (minimum 3 days)
3. Majority approval required
4. Tech lead has veto power

**Version History:**
- Track all changes with version numbers
- Document rationale for major changes

### Regular Review

- Review constitution quarterly
- Update technology stack as needed
- Adjust standards based on lessons learned
